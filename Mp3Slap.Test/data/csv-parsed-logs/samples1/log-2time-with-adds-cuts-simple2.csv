# notes:
# we FORBID adds with only 1 / start time
# It's true, with only 2 times, it seems dumb to do or need adds
# Like if 1m-3m needs to change to 1m-2m, 2m-3m, you would already
# have to ADD "2m-3m", so why not just manually alter the first
# "-3m" to "-2m"?
# But for more than just 2-times, it's really convenient to not
# have to then calculate durations. Also, IF the added start time doesn't
# overlap the previous end time, the add aspect is just ignored

# KISS: really simple point clarifies:
# ADD 
01:00, 04:00
+01:30, 02:30
+02:30, 03:00
# last one, tho is 2 adds in a row, the 2nd of them is IGNORED as and
# add bec prev (add, yes, but it doesn't matter) ended at 2:30, so no cut time

03:00, 04:30

# above demonstrates the first '04:00' is just TOTALLY ignored and lost
# adds always have to have end times and that simplifies this,
# making adds LIMITED to cutting the p
